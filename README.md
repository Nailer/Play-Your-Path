# Play Your Path (PYP) üåç

Players play to progress as they learn about Hedera and earn points
üèÜ Hackathon Track: Gaming and NFTs

PYP is more than a game ‚Äî it's a proof-of-game platform, tracking user activities, rewarding progress with NFTs & tokens, and building a blockchain reputation.

## üïπÔ∏è Core Features

### 1. The House (Main Hub)
**Rooms = Activities:**
- **üìñ Study Room**: Take quizzes, complete courses ‚Üí earn NFTs
- **üõãÔ∏è Work Bench/Table**: Simulate working ‚Üí generate meme tokens, collectibles, NFTs
- **üêü Aquarium (Fish Oracle)**: AI-powered fish that answers questions, analyzes your wallet, gives insights, assigns tasks, and distributes rewards
- **üå± Garden/Weed Planting**: Plant daily ‚Üí earn token rewards (daily engagement loop)
- **üõçÔ∏è Marketplace**: Trade NFTs and meme tokens
- **üó≥Ô∏è Council Room**: Participate in governance via tokens

### 2. Social & Community
- Friend system to connect with others
- Shared spaces for interaction, chats, and events
- Mini-games and challenges for community bonding

### 3. AI Integration
The Fish Oracle acts as an in-game mentor:
- Wallet analysis
- Learning assistance
- Task generation
- Reward distribution

### 4. Proof of Game & Reputation
- Every action (planting, learning, quizzes, meme creation, working, invasions) is tracked
- Progress builds a reputation system (blockchain-based)
- Rewards include NFTs, tokens, and increased security tiers for your house

### 5. Gameplay & Strategy

## üéÆ Demo Summary

- **PYP Hub (The House)**: Central hub with interactive rooms
- **Mode Overlay**: Learn, Play, Trade, Govern, Teleport
- **External Worlds**:
  - Village Square (community events)
  - Festival Grounds (seasonal events)

- **Wallet Integration**: HashPack login with Hedera token support
- **AI Companion**: Fish Oracle for guidance and rewards
- **Blockchain Features**:

## Architecture

- React app shell hosts the original game in an iframe
- Legacy game assets live in `public/game` and remain fully static
- Overlay UI injects PYP modes/teleport and Hedera hooks
- Hedera SDK service provides account creation, token and NFT operations
- Supabase stores user profiles and Hedera account metadata

Directory highlights:

- `src/services/hederaService.js`: client init, create account, token/NFT helpers
- `src/lib/supabase.js`: profile + hedera_accounts CRUD
- `src/HederaAccountSetup.js`: guided flow to create testnet accounts
- `public/game/*.html`: original The House scenes, rethemed as PYP Hub + maps

## Hedera Integrations (Testnet)

- Create Hedera Account (funded with 20 HBAR from operator)
- NFT Collections (create/mint) for badges
- Fungible Token helpers (create/mint/transfer/associate)
- Balance sync via Mirror Node (read-only)

Environment variables (add to `.env`):

```
REACT_APP_HEDERA_OPERATOR_ID=0.0.xxxxxx
REACT_APP_HEDERA_OPERATOR_KEY=302e02...
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## Supabase Schema

See `supabase-schema.sql`:

- `user_profiles`: id (UUID), email, name, auth_type, wallet_address
- `hedera_accounts`: user_id (UUID), account_id, evm_address, keys, balance
- `user_achievements`: badge/event logs, optional NFT linkage
- `user_governance`: proposal votes and power

Row-Level Security (RLS) policies included for user scoping.

## Getting Started

1) Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

2) Create `.env` from `env.example`, set Hedera + Supabase vars, then restart dev server
```
npm start
```

3) Login
- HashPack: browser extension
- Email/Password: simple local flow that also creates a profile record

4) Create a Hedera account (email users)
- Click Create Hedera Account (top bar) ‚Üí copy private key safely

5) Play
- Use the overlay to choose Learn/Play/Trade/Govern or Teleport
- Earn badges/tokens (demo flows)

## Why This Matters

- **African Identity**: inspired by cultural symbolism (juju portals, village interactions, communal play)

- **Community Economy**: Meme tokens, NFT trading, governance ‚Äî all user-driven
- **AI x Blockchain**: A fun and practical bridge between intelligence and decentralized ownership

## Vision

Africa is one of the fastest-growing adopters of Web3. Play Your Path reimagines how learning, gaming, and community can blend in a culturally rooted, blockchain-powered environment.

PYP creates a world where every action counts, every player owns their path, and every community thrives together.
